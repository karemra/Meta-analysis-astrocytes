Overview
This repository contains the code, data processing scripts, and statistical analysis for a meta-analysis focused on astrocyte transcriptomic responses 
The goal of this project is to synthesize data from multiple studies to identify consistent patterns in astrocyte reactivity

# RNA-seq: a step-by-step analysis pipeline.

- Pre-alignment quality control (QC)
- Align to the reference human genome
- Quantify transcripts
